Advantages of React Hook Form
1. Performance
Minimal re-renders (only touched fields re-render)

No unnecessary state updates

Faster than formik and other alternatives

2. Developer Experience
Simple API with register function

Easy integration with UI libraries

Great TypeScript support

Comprehensive documentation

3. Flexibility
Works with any UI library

Supports custom validation

Easy to integrate with validation libraries (Yup, Zod, etc.)

Controlled and uncontrolled components

4. Bundle Size
Very lightweight (~9KB)

Tree-shakable

No external dependencies

Disadvantages & Challenges
1. Learning Curve
Different approach than traditional form libraries

Requires understanding of uncontrolled components

Complex validation scenarios need additional setup

2. UI Library Integration
Requires Controller component for controlled components

Slightly more boilerplate for complex UI libraries

3. Debugging
Less intuitive debugging for complex forms

Error messages can be cryptic

4. Dependency on DOM
Relies on native DOM validation attributes

Can be challenging with custom input components
